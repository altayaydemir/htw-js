##Half Term with Javascript

> As a senior Mechanical Engineering student who wants to focus on web related areas after graduation, I decided to practice Javascript during my last half term as an undergraduate. 

> I have been dealing with coding stuff since the beginning of this year (2015) and I have done several projects by using HTML, CSS, a little bit JQuery, PHP (pure first, then Laravel) and Django. I also completed Javascript and AngularJS courses on Codecademy but since I didn't write JS in real life projects, I need lots of practice.

> This repository contains the path I follow while trying to gain an intermediate understanding and knowledge of Javascript itself and modern tools built with it.

##Studies

###Part One
I started to my journey by reading the first six parts of [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke.

Then I've watched the [Introduction to EcmaScript 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlrirWY9JTk) by Üstün Özgür.

I'm also trying to solve some challanges on [Codewars](www.codewars.com).

###Part Two
In the second week, I decided to take a look at NodeJS. 

First, I've read [The Art of Node by Max Ogden](https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node#) and then I take a look at the [LearnYouNode](https://www.github.com/workshopper/learnyounode) exercies on [nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/).

Then I've followed the parts about Node, Express and MongoDB of [MEAN Machine](https://leanpub.com/mean-machine), a satisfactory book for introduction to MEAN stack, written by [scotch.io](http://scotch.io) team.

###Part Three
Since I want to learn and build things with React, and MEAN Machine is doing the front-end jobs with Angular, I decided to skip rest of it for now.
