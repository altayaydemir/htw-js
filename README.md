#~~Half~~ Last Term with Javascript

> As a senior Mechanical Engineering student who wants to focus on web related areas after graduation, I decided to practice Javascript during my last half term as an undergraduate. 

> I've been trying to learn some coding stuff since the beginning of 2015 and I have done several projects by using HTML, CSS, JQuery and Django. I also completed Javascript and AngularJS courses on Codecademy but since I haven't write JS in ~~any~~ real life projects, I need lots of practice.

> This repository contains the path I follow while trying to gain an understanding and knowledge of the language itself and modern tools/frameworks built with it.

> **UPDATE (01.04.2016)**: Since this repo was kind of beneficial for me and some of my friends who wanted to take a look at JS or React Ecosystem during the past months, I decided to keep it updated till the end of this semester. You can also check [this repository](https://github.com/altayaydemir/ephas) for the some of the problems (and their solutions) I've dealt during these works.
