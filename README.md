##Half Term with Javascript

> As a senior Mechanical Engineering student who wants to focus on web related areas after graduation, I decided to practice Javascript during my last half term as an undergraduate. 

> I have been dealing with coding stuff since the beginning of this year (2015) and I have done several projects by using HTML, CSS, JQuery, PHP (pure first, then Laravel) and Django. I also completed Javascript and AngularJS courses on Codecademy but since I didn't write JS in real life projects, I need lots of practice.

> This repository contains the path I follow while trying to gain an intermediate understanding and knowledge of Javascript.

##Week One
I started to my journey by reading [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke.

I'm also trying to solve some challanges on [Codewars](www.codewars.com).
